      text: As mentioned above, my main goal is to be more confortable with
        JavaScript, and I'll be approaching this first by taking an open-source
        course on GitHub, Asabeneh / 30-Days-Of-JavaScript, and then progress on
        from there.

        In addition to learning JavaScript, I'll also be building various
        projects in other programming languages like Python, etc.
